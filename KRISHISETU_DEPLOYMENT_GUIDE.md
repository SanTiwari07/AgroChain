# KrishiSetu Blockchain Integration - Complete Setup Guide

## 🎉 Successfully Updated: AgriChain → KrishiSetu

Your blockchain project has been successfully updated from "AgriChain" to "KrishiSetu"! Here's what was changed and how to run your project.

## 📋 Changes Made

### 1. Smart Contract Updates
- ✅ Renamed contract from `AgriChain` to `KrishiSetu`
- ✅ Updated contract file: `contracts/KrishiSetu.sol`
- ✅ Updated all contract references in deployment scripts
- ✅ Changed product ID format from `AGRI-*` to `KRISHI-*`

### 2. Frontend Integration Updates
- ✅ Updated `blockchainService.ts` to use KrishiSetu
- ✅ Changed ABI constant from `AGRICHAIN_ABI` to `KRISHISETU_ABI`
- ✅ Updated contract address references
- ✅ Updated network name to "KrishiSetu Local"
- ✅ Updated product ID generation to use "KRISHI" prefix

### 3. Deployment Script Updates
- ✅ Updated deployment script to use KrishiSetu contract
- ✅ Updated sample product IDs to use KRISHI prefix
- ✅ Updated all console messages and references

## 🚀 How to Run Your Project

### Step 1: Start the Blockchain Network

Open a terminal and navigate to the blockchain directory:
```bash
cd "Blockchain/seed-to-shelf-flow-main/smart-contracts"
```

Start a local Hardhat node:
```bash
npx hardhat node
```
Keep this terminal running - it provides the blockchain network.

### Step 2: Deploy the KrishiSetu Contract

Open a new terminal and navigate to the same directory:
```bash
cd "Blockchain/seed-to-shelf-flow-main/smart-contracts"
```

Deploy the contract:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

This will:
- Deploy the KrishiSetu contract
- Register 3 sample products (KRISHI-DEMO-001, KRISHI-DEMO-002, KRISHI-DEMO-003)
- Simulate supply chain updates
- Display the contract address

### Step 3: Update Frontend Configuration

Copy the contract address from the deployment output and update the frontend:

1. Open `frontendNbackend/src/services/blockchainService.ts`
2. Update line 33 with the new contract address:
```typescript
export const KRISHISETU_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = ENV_CONTRACT_ADDRESS || "YOUR_NEW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS";
```

### Step 4: Start the Frontend

Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd "frontendNbackend"
```

Install dependencies (if not already done):
```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 5: Connect MetaMask

1. Open your browser and go to the frontend URL (usually http://localhost:5173)
2. Install MetaMask if not already installed
3. Add the local network to MetaMask:
   - Network Name: KrishiSetu Local
   - RPC URL: http://localhost:8545
   - Chain ID: 31337
   - Currency Symbol: ETH
4. Import one of the test accounts from the Hardhat node output
5. Connect MetaMask to the frontend

## 🧪 Testing the Integration

### Test 1: View Sample Products
- Navigate to the farmer dashboard
- You should see the 3 sample products registered during deployment

### Test 2: Register New Product
- Use the farmer dashboard to register a new product
- Product ID will automatically use "KRISHI-" prefix

### Test 3: Supply Chain Updates
- Use distributor dashboard to update products
- Use retailer dashboard to add products to store
- View transaction history for each product

## 📁 Key Files Updated

### Blockchain Files:
- `Blockchain/seed-to-shelf-flow-main/smart-contracts/contracts/KrishiSetu.sol`
- `Blockchain/seed-to-shelf-flow-main/smart-contracts/scripts/deploy.js`
- `Blockchain/seed-to-shelf-flow-main/smart-contracts/test-krishisetu.js`

### Frontend Files:
- `frontendNbackend/src/services/blockchainService.ts`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot connect to network localhost"
**Solution:** Make sure the Hardhat node is running in a separate terminal.

### Issue: "Contract not found at address"
**Solution:** Redeploy the contract and update the contract address in the frontend.

### Issue: MetaMask connection fails
**Solution:** 
1. Make sure you're connected to the correct network (Chain ID: 31337)
2. Import a test account from the Hardhat node output
3. Make sure the account has some ETH for gas fees

### Issue: Frontend shows no products
**Solution:** 
1. Check that the contract address is correct
2. Verify the contract was deployed successfully
3. Check browser console for error messages

## 🎯 What's Working Now

✅ **Smart Contract**: KrishiSetu contract deployed and functional
✅ **Product Registration**: Farmers can register products with KRISHI-* IDs
✅ **Supply Chain Tracking**: Distributors and retailers can update products
✅ **Transaction History**: Complete audit trail for each product
✅ **Frontend Integration**: All dashboards connected to KrishiSetu contract
✅ **MetaMask Integration**: Wallet connection and transaction signing

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test All Features**: Go through each dashboard and test all functionality
2. **Customize UI**: Update any remaining "AgriChain" references in the UI
3. **Add More Features**: Extend the contract with additional functionality
4. **Deploy to Testnet**: Deploy to a public testnet for broader testing
5. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to mainnet when ready

Your KrishiSetu blockchain integration is now ready to use! 🌾
